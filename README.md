## Experience Using GitHub
This project helped me understand Git workflows, including branching, pull requests, and issue tracking.

## Challenges Faced
1. **Merge Conflicts**: While merging `feature-1`, I encountered a conflict in `hello.cpp`. 
   - **Solution**: Used `git merge feature-1`, manually resolved conflicts, and committed the changes.

2. **Git Push Errors**: I faced issues pushing due to authentication problems.
   - **Solution**: Configured SSH keys using `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096`.

## Lessons Learned
- How to efficiently collaborate using Git branches and PRs.
- The importance of clear commit messages.
- Resolving merge conflicts properly.

## Future Improvements
- Automate documentation updates.
- Improve code organization with modular programming.
